# Snowflake generation using probabilistic L-systems

Snowflakes are a beautiful creation from nature. Due to the dipole behaviour of water molecules and the arrangement of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, snowflakes are made up of a grid structure that results in symmetrical growth along 6 axis arranged in a hexagon. As there are numerous parameters influencing the shape of the snowflake (temperature, humidity, pressure, ...) as it falls down from the sky, it is said that every snowflake is unique.

This application shall capture the perfect symmetry and uniqueness of snowflakes by modelling them in a probabilistic L-system.
