    <h1>Snowflake generation using probabilistic L-systems</h1>
    <h3>Art, Mathematics and Technology Masterpiece by Elisa Nguyen (s2399423)</h3>
    <p>Snowflakes are a beautiful creation from nature. Due to the dipole behaviour of water molecules and the
        arrangement of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms, snowflakes are made up of a grid structure that results in
        symmetrical growth along 6 axis arranged in a hexagon. As there are numerous parameters influencing the shape of
        the snowflake (temperature, humidity, pressure, ...) as they fall down from the sky, it is said that every
        snowflake is unique.</p>

    <p>This artwork shall capture the perfect symmetry and uniqueness of snowflakes by modelling them in
        a probabilistic L-system and animating snowfall in a clear winter sky.</p>

    <p>By clicking the button, you can let it snow. 2 windows will appear, one where you can see one by one how the
        snowflakes are drawn, and the other one displaying the final masterpiece once all snowflakes have been
        generated.</p>
